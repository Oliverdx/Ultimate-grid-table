# Ultimate Grid Data

Application to exhibiting a huge amount of data provided by a json file

## How to Run

To run the project go to the terminal and navigate to the folder's project

`npm install`

After install all the packages to run the project in the browser will be necessary
run the code, and we have two types

### Deployable version (optimized)

If you want to run the final version who goes to the deploy and is optimized you can type

`npm run build`

and then

`npm start`

this version will have a optimized version of the app with can run must faster and performatic,
but if you want to try to put the hands in the code and try something follow the procedures below

### Running as a developer (edit the code)

To run the code as a developer with hot reload when save any file you can simple type de code in the terminal

`npm run dev`

in both cases after the process of build done, access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
to view the page rendered

## Technologies used

- [x] NodeJS
- [x] NextJS (React Framework)
- [x] Rematch
- [x] Babel
- [x] Sass
- [x] Lowdb
- [ ] A lot experience

## Some Ideas for the future

- [ ] Edit data
- [ ] Add new data to the json
- [ ] Improve the reading of the json
- [ ] Design improvements

In case to improve to something better and more reliable is good to change to MongoDb, SQL
or any database to make easy the process of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Final Considerations

All the design and the technologies applied here was for a quick test,
some technologies used was only for fulfill the requirements of it,
the intencion was not to be used in production as it is right now.
for that is necessary fulfill some of the improvements listed before.
